## Less Wierd

A little library to make javascript less wierd.

Basically, this is bundle of must-use javascript one-liners. It has a small size of 4.14kB(unpacked).

### Quick Start / Installation

To install "less wierd" to your project you can do either of the following:

```bash

npm i less-wierd

```

or

```bash

yarn add less-wierd

```

### Inspiration

I love javascript and many others too, but there are a lot of haters too. People hate javascript because it is "wierd". I want to help make javascript a little easier so that you don't have to write those one-liners again and again.
